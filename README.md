# Social todo automated tests

These are the tests for the social todo.

## Running the code

You can download binaries on the [releases](https://github.com/yale-cpsc-213/social-todo-selenium-tests/releases) section of this repo on GitHub.

You'll need to make the code executable (likely `chmod` or the Windows equivalent). The code runs the tests by automating a browser via the [WebDriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) protocol. When I completed the assignment, I used either [Selenium stand-alone server](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) or
[ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) as my interface to Chrome.

Once you have one of those, you can run either

```
selenium-server -port 4444
```

or

```
chromedriver --port 4444
```

Clearly, you can use whatever port you want. Then, you run the test code like this

```
social-todo-selenium-tests "http://localhost:4444/wd/hub" "http://localhost:8000"
```

if you are using selenium or

```
social-todo-selenium-tests "http://localhost:4444" "http://localhost:8000"
```

if you are using ChromeDriver (with which you don't need `/wd/hub`). That will run
the tests against your app running on port `8000`. You can, of course, point it anywhere,
including at my demo apps. In my experience, ChromeDriver is a little faster than Selenium.

## Expected output

When all the tests pass, you should see this.

```

## Tips

* Most of the tests are in the `tests.go` file.
* The CSS selectors we are using to interact with your app are in the `selectors.go` file. You'll need to structure your HTML and CSS such that the code passes.
* Use the `-fast` flag if you want to save some time.
* If you want to alter this code, e.g. slow down your browser, simply clone with repo into your `$GOPATH`. On my system, this code lives at `/Users/kljensen/go/src/github.com/yale-cpsc-213/social-todo-selenium-tests`. Then run `go get` and `go build`. This was built with go1.7.4.
